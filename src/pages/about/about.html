            <h1>About SoCal Cigar Shops</h1>

            <p>This is a personal project originally developed for the Front End JavaScript course that I took while
                attending
                Udacity's Full Stack Web Development Nano Degree program. It was my expression of the "Neighborhood Map"
                project in that
                course.
            </p>
            <p>It attempts to answer the question "Where are the good cigar stores in Southern California". It
                aggregates the
                tools that I would use (Google & Yelp) to answer this question. I'm attempting to improve on both of
                those tools
                by actively ignoring those establishments that a real cigar smoker wouldn't consider to be a real cigar
                store.
            </p>
            <h2>What is a Real Cigar Store?</h2>
            <p>Cigar smoking is a social activity. There is a camaraderie of cigar smokers that real cigar stores
                facilitate.</p>
            <p>So by my humble definition a real cigar store is one where cigar smokers can both buy cigars and also sit
                with
                others and smoke them. Thankfully this isn't all that hard to find in Southern California. </p>
            <p>A real cigar store has several characteristics:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>An establishment whose main business is selling cigars and tobacco pipes - in short - a
                    tobacconist
                </li>
                <li>A walk-in humidor with a wide range of cigars.</li>
                <li>A sales person who actually smokes cigars and is knowledgable about them.</li>
                <li>A sales person who can carry on a conversation about the cigars in English.</li>
                <li>A relaxing place where the cigars purchased there can be smoked.</li>
                <li>Very little to none of the non-tobacco paraphernalia found in head shops and cheap cigarette stores.
                    Paraphernalia
                    such as "glass", vaporizers, vape juice and cigarettes by the case are not characteristic of a real
                    cigar store.
                </li>
                <li>Friendly patrons are always a plus.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Sure, you can buy cigars at convenience stores and large liquor stores. The experience however, is just
                as impersonal as buying cigars online. There is a time and place for it but in those situations you are
                participating
                in a simple transaction. When you buy a cigar at a real cigar store you promote the ethic and
                camaraderie of the
                real cigar smoker.</p>
            <h2>Thank God for California</h2>
            <p>California is the only state on the west coast where one can buy a cigar and smoke it the same establishment.
            </p>
            <p>In Washington and Oregon the only exception to this is in Indian owned casinos.  Washington does make some
            provision for outdoor smoking areas adjacent to cigar stores but the weather there is rarely conducive.</p>
            <p>Every time I light up I think a little thanks for California.</p>
